Have a good day!
TEAMWORK: A few harmless flakes together can unleash an avalanche of destruction.
I don't need help.
Accept, that you're a product, not a gift.
You're worth it.
Death is everywhere.
Everybody is given the same number of hours every day to accomplish what they want to accomplish, and that's 24... no more, no less.
You are a failure.
You can achieve everything, you can dream of.
Everybody just pretends to like you, even your mom.
You woke up today. Congrats!
I'm tired of masturbating. I want to be loved.
Be comfy
