Have a good day!
TEAMWORK: A few harmless flakestogether can unleash an avalanche of destruction.
I don't need help.
Accept, that you're a product, not a gift.
You're worth it.
Death is everywhere.
Everybody is given the same number of hours every day to accomplish what they want to accomplish, and that's 24... no more, no less.
You are a failure.
You can achieve everything, you can dream of.
